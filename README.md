# Beavers-CNC

This is a project of home made CNC witch is for now consist of ESC stack boards, magnetic encoder PCB, on-chip debugger board projects.

Module Alder-1 E00001 is a digital part of ESC based on STM32F446 and DRV8305 and designed for FOC motor control.

Module Oak-1 E00003 is a power part of ESC witch may differ for different motors and provide external connection for Alder-1.

Module Apple-1 E00007 is a magnetic encoder board.

Module Blackthorn-1 E00009 is an on-chip debugger PCB based on DAP-Link design with galvanic isolation.
